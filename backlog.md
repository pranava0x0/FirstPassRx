# Backlog

Ideas, each with a priority (low / medium / high). Reprioritize periodically.

## High

- **Confirm the MD Medicaid menopause `partial` cells against the dispensing MCOs.** The FFS PDL
  doesn't manage HRT, so the FFS cells are `partial`. Pull the managed-care formularies (Priority
  Partners, Maryland Physicians Care, Wellpoint/Amerigroup, etc.) to confirm the per-MCO tiering and
  the brand vaginal insert/ring (Imvexxy, Estring, Femring) PA status, then flip to `verified`.
- **Finish verifying the `partial` / `example` cells.** MassHealth and MGB are largely `verified`;
  Tufts and Harvard Pilgrim are `partial` (formulary PDFs verified, per-cell agent inferred); BCBS
  MA is `example` (inhaler policy PDF returned HTTP 403 to the fetcher). Read each formulary PDF,
  confirm the preferred agent + reject list + step text, and flip `verification` to `verified` with
  an updated `verificationNote`. See `data-sources.md`.
- **Biologics & non-inhaler class** (currently a disabled tab). Omalizumab (Xolair, now with the
  Omlyclo biosimilar), mepolizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab, tezepelumab — specialty-pharmacy /
  buy-and-bill with their own PA pathway. Cite FDA + manufacturer; the sources research already
  gathered the key facts.
- **Patient Synonym search mapping** (Newbie/Patient): Support mapping layperson search terms
  (e.g., "rescue spray", "blue inhaler", "steroid pump", "COPD breath") to their clinical drug classes
  or specific molecules in the search index so patients without medical background find what they need.

## Medium

- **MD menopause: ship the `combo` class + more payers.** Estrogen–progestogen combination products
  (Combipatch, Bijuva, Climara Pro, generic estradiol/norethindrone) are scaffolded as a disabled
  `combo` tab — source and enable them. Add UnitedHealthcare and Aetna of Maryland as payers.
- **Automate PA Appeal** (currently a disabled button): pre-fill the payer's PA form / appeal letter
  from the selected cell's step-therapy text and reject reasons.
- **Deep-link state to the URL** (`?plan=masshealth&class=icslaba`) so a prescriber can bookmark or
  share a specific cell, and the search result can be shared.
- **Freshness badge** that turns amber when a cell's `lastReviewed` is > 90 days old (formularies
  change quarterly).
- **Print / hand-out view** of a plan's full preferred grid for a clinic binder or the patient.
- **Quantity limits** as a first-class field (the formularies carry QL codes alongside PA/ST).
- **Surface the strength/dose in the open answer** (Expert): the patient-first refactor moved the
  strength (e.g. "90 mcg") and clinical sig behind the "Prescription text for clinician" `<details>`.
  That is the one load-bearing number a prescriber needs every time — show it as a quiet line in the
  open answer (DESIGN.md "one surface, two audiences"), without bringing back the rest of the jargon.
- **Inhaler Spacer & Technique instructions** (Patient/Newbie): Show simple device-specific instructions
  (MDI vs. DPI technique) based on the preferred agent's delivery type (e.g. HFA inhalers benefit from
  spacers and slow deep breathing, while dry-powder inhalers need a fast, forceful breath).
- **Insurance Card Helper (Payer finder)** (Newbie): Add a mini-guide explaining how patients can locate
  their plan, PBM, RxBIN, and RxGroup on their physical insurance card to select the correct plan.

## Low

- ESLint + Prettier (kept out of MVP to minimize dependency surface; tsc strict covers types). When
  added, wire the design ban-list regex (no `bg-(indigo|violet|purple)`, `rounded-2xl`, `shadow-lg`,
  gradients) into CI per docs/design.md.
- GitHub Actions Pages deploy (SHA-pinned `actions/*`) as an alternative to the `gh-pages` branch.
- Dark theme — invert to a warm near-black canvas, darken the three status hues one stop to hold AA.
- **Compact Clinic Grid Layout** (Expert/UX): Add a toggle for a compact side-by-side comparison matrix of
  all 5 plans for the active class, optimized for rapid clinical scanning and printing.
