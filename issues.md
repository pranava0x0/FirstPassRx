# Issues

Living audit trail. Each bug: date, area, description, root cause (code bug vs. test bug), status.

## Open

- **2026-06-28 · data (MA inhalers) · dead source citation.** `npm run trace:live` flags the MGB
  Fluticasone HFA PA Policy URL (`mgb-flut-hfa-pa`, cited by `mgb/ics`) as **HTTP 404** — the policy
  PDF moved on the MGB site. Root cause: **source drift** (the website changed), not a code bug.
  Fix: re-locate the current policy on the MGB pharmacy-policy index and update `meta.references`
  for `mgb-flut-hfa-pa`. Out of this session's MD scope; logged for the MA pass. _Open._
- **2026-06-28 · data (MA inhalers) · slow/JS-only sources.** `trace:live` also flags MassHealth
  PA-37 (timeout on the Conduent host) and the BCBS-MA / MassHealth-Table-23 / MGB-policy-index
  pages as content "drift" — they are JS-rendered portals, so the static HTML lacks the drug names.
  Not broken, but un-traceable by static fetch; verify manually or via the source PDF. _Open._
